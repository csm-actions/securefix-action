## Features

#317 Support enabling `auto-merge` after creating pull requests

You can enable auto-merge after creating pull requests.
To use this feature, you need to set the input `automerge_method` of the client action.

e.g.

```yaml
- uses: csm-actions/securefix-action@latest
  with:
    app_id: ${{vars.APP_ID}}
    app_private_key: ${{secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY}}
    server_repository: securefix-demo-server
    branch: test-4
    pull_request_title: Title
    pull_request_base_branch: develop
    automerge_method: "squash" # Enable auto-merge. The merge method is `squash`
```
