## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

Since `files` is not joined with `root_dir`, `root_dir` must point to the Git root directory.
Otherwise, the `files` option will not work correctly.

## Features

Because `files` is passed as arguments to `git ls-files`, you can now specify directories and glob patterns.

## Bug Fxies

Fix a bug that it fails to create pull requests to other repositories.
