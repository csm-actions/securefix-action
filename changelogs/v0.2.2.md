## Features

#208 Support specifying the root directory path of fixed files

The input `root_dir` is added to the client action.

e.g.

```yaml
    - uses: csm-actions/securefix-action@latest
      with:
        app_id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
        app_private_key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        server_repository: demo-server
        root_dir: docs # By default, this is empty (${{github.workspace}})
        # files must be relative paths from root_dir
        files: index.html
```

This is useful when the repository is checked out on the different path from `${{github.workspace}}`.
