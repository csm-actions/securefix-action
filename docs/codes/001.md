# Error: No matching entry found in the config for the given repository and branch.

This error occurs if you try to push a commit to disallowed repository or branch.

By default, Securefix Action pushes a commit to the repository and branch where the action is run.
To push a commit to a different repository or branch, you need to allow the repository and branch in the server configuration file.

[Please see here](../README.md#push-to-other-repository-and-branch).
